# Lab 5

This Lab 5 implemented concepts of accessibility such as utilizing appropriate tags, modifying html to accomdate for screen readers, modifying tags to utilize the 'tab' keyboard accessibility tool, and others code cleanup to make files more aesthetic.

## Testing

Besides checking the accessibility when inspecting my website, there are no tests

## Accessibility Lab Answers
The dimensions of the website does not fit the page.
There are no header tags, <font size="x"></font> in place instead.
No paragraph tags.
Too many break tags around header tags, lessen white space.
Wrapped the navigation bar with <nav> tags instead of <div> tags.

For the most part, everything visually about the website is already good quality. A lot of the accessibility implementation focused on screen reader accessibility and correct tag usage.
